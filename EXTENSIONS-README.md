#EXTENSIONS-README
- To make the Shrdlite feel more personal all speech has been revised with new more personal phrases.
- This version also tells what object it is picking up along the plan and where it puts it.
- The grammar has been changed to include "Why did you move the red box" etc. This gives the user the ability to ask why the robot moved a particular object along its plan.
